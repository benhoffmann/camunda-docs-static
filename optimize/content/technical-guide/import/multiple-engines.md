There are two possible setup, where multiple engine can be used:

* [Multiple engines with a shared Database](#multiple-engines-with-a-shared-database)
* [Multiple engines with a distributed Database](#multiple-engines-with-a-distributed-database)

Please check, which scenario corresonds to your setup, because the configuration of multiple engine to Optimize is not always suited for the best import performance.

# Multiple engines with a shared Database

In this scenario you have multiple engines distributed in a cluster, where each engine instance is connected to a shared database. See the following diagram for an illustration:

{{< img src="../img/Clustered-Engine-Shared-Database.png" title="Clustered Engine with shared Database" >}}

Now it could be possible to connect each engine to Optimize. However, the would conclude that Optimize imports the data from each engine. Since every engine accesses the same data through the shared database, Optimize would import the engine data multiple times. What is more desired in this scenario is to balance the work load on each engine during the import. Therefore, it is adviced to place a load balancer between the engines and Optimize. Thus, Optimize would only communicate to the load balancer. The following diagramm depicts the described setup:

{{< img src="../img/Multiple-Engine-Shared-Database.png" title="Multiple Engines with shared Database connected to Optimize" >}}

# Multiple engines with a distributed Database

In this scenario you have multiple engines distributed in a cluster, but this time each engine has its own database. See the following diagram for an illustration:

{{< img src="../img/Clustered-Engine-Distributed-Database.png" title="Clustered Engine with distributed Database" >}}

Now you are able to connect each engine to Optimize. The data will then automatically be imported into Optimize. The following diagramm depicts the setup:

{{< img src="../img/Multiple-Engine-Distributed-Database.png" title="Multiple Engines connected to Optimize, each having its own Database" >}}

In order to set up the connections to the engines, you need add the information to the [configuration file]({{< relref "technical-guide/configuration/index.md" >}}). For the sake of simplicity, let's assume we have two departments, sales and marketing, each having their own engine with its own database and processes. Both are accessible in the local network. The sales engine has the port `8080` and the marketing engine the port `1234`. Now an excerpt of the configuration, could look like the following:
```json
"engines": {
  "sales": {
    "name": "/engine/default",
    "rest": "http://localhost:8080/engine-rest",
    "authentication": {
      "accessGroup": "",
      "enabled": false,
      "password": "",
      "user": ""
    },
    "enabled": true
  },
  "marketing": {
    "name": "/engine/default",
    "rest": "http://localhost:1234/engine-rest",
    "authentication": {
      "accessGroup": "",
      "enabled": false,
      "password": "",
      "user": ""
    },
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

`sales` and `marketing` are custom names, that we chose in order to distinguish later on, where the data was originally imported from.
